		<p>For anyone building their very first webpage, the journey begins with a foundational understanding of HTML, the core language for structuring web content. Starting with a plain text editor, you write a simple series of tags that define the page's basic layout, such as the title that appears in the browser tab and the body that will hold all the visible content. While the first result might look plain and unstyled, seeing your own creation appear in a browser window is an exciting moment that marks a major milestone in web development. This initial experience, often a simple "Hello, World!" project, establishes the fundamental concept that with just a few lines of code, you can build and publish content for the world to see. From this starting point, it's possible to expand your knowledge to CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity, but the foundation laid with that first page is the most essential step.</p><br/>
		<p>User login is a security process that verifies a user's identity before granting access to a system, application, or service. The most traditional method requires a user to enter a username and password, which the system then compares against a securely stored record. If the credentials match, the user is authenticated and permitted to access their account and associated resources. In today's digital world, enhanced login security often includes multi-factor authentication (MFA), which adds an extra layer of protection by requiring a second form of verification, such as a code sent to a mobile device or a biometric scan. By controlling access to sensitive data and systems, a robust login process is a foundational element of cybersecurity, protecting both user privacy and organizational assets from unauthorized entry.To login tap<a href="login.html" id="anchor"> here.</a></p>
